# AraSum 


This repository contains the **AraSum** corpus which is the first monolingual corpus in the Arabic language for abstractive text summarization.



We are releasing the **AraSum** corpus which is the first monolingual corpus for abstractive text summarization for the Arabic language. The **AraSum** corpus contains 49604 articles and their corresponding leads.


The source for **AraSum** corpus is the Arabic version of the Deutsche Welle DW news website. The downloaded items address a wide range of topics, not only dealing with politics, sports, or art. This allows the summary database to cover a wide range of topics, making more realistic testing of the capabilities of the summarization models as well as the creation of more robust and less domain-dependent models possible.


Dataset files are in ```.csv``` and ```.txt``` format . <!-- One example is given below in the ```.txt``` format:-->
